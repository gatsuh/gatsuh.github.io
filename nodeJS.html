                <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is node.js?</h3>
        <p>Primarily speaking, node.js is a javascript framework that is asynchronous, event-driven, and is built within
            the javascript of one of the most sophisticated browsers we have today, Chrome.</p>

        <p>I have found it's primary purpose seems to be to allow concurrency while running preventing a program from
        having to wait for a new response. This allows it to compile multiple different processes simultaneously which
        allows the framework to scale exponentially.</p>

        <h3>
            <a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true">
                <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why should I use node.js?</h3>

        <p>This depends on your needs. If you are working with a lot of user driven events in your applications then the
        concurrent response time this allows would be great for you.</p>

        <p>However, if you are working with a resource intensive application, such as data-streaming research modules or
            3d modeling for example, this may prove to be something you may want to re-examine using.</p>

        <p>One of the biggest boons to this framework is it's non-blocking IO and the simple fact that, unlike every
            other framework available, node.js has been built with this key concept in mind from the ground up.</p>

        <h3>
            <a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true">
                <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Non-blocking IO?</h3>

        <p>Essentially non-blocking IO is node.js's ability to function on a single thread using non-blocking IO calls.
        This allows it to support incredible amounts of concurrent connections. This alleviates the stress of multiple
        thread structures that require excessive amounts of memory to keep up with all of these concurrent threads.</p>
        <p>In theory, actually, node.js and it's ability to avoid the previous scenario can hold upwards of 1 million
        connections! This to me was absolutely astounding lending to nearly limitless potential for connectivity.</p>
